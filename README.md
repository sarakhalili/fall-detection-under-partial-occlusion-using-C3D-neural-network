# fall-detection-under-partial-occlusion-using-C3D-neural-network
One of the most possible dangers that older people face in their daily lives is falling. A fall is an accident that results in disability and crippling. If the person is not able to inform others about their condition after a fall, this dilemma gets more critical, and the person may even lose their life; therefore, the existence of intelligent and efficient systems for detecting falls in the elderly is essential. As deep learning and computer vision have developed in recent years, researchers have used these techniques to detect falls. Among the computer vision challenges, occlusion is one of the biggest challenges of these systems and degrades their performance to a considerable extent. Here, we provide an effective solution for occlusion handling in vision-based fall detection systems. We propose a fall detection algorithm under partial occlusion using the C3D neural network presented in [fall-detection-under-partial-occlusion-using-C3D-neural-network]([https://github.com/amrn9674/Fall-Detection_Dynamical_haar_Cascade](https://github.com/sarakhalili/fall-detection-under-partial-occlusion-using-C3D-neural-network) to tackle this problem.
